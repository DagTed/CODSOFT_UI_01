Codsoft UI/UX Internship Project 1

Mobile App Signup Flow

Description
This project is part of the Codsoft UI/UX Internship and focuses on designing and implementing an intuitive, user-friendly Mobile App Signup Flow. The goal was to create a seamless experience for users to register while ensuring security, personalization, and simplicity.

My Role
As the UI/UX designer and developer I d esigned the user interface (UI) for the signup flow.
Addressed user experience (UX) challenges to enhance usability.

Challenges
Balancing simplicity with the need to collect useful data.

Design Strategy:
Identify the critical data required to create an account
Limit the signup form to only the essential fields (Name, Email, Password) to implement a progressive disclosure approach: collect additional information (e.g., preferences, profile details) after the user has signed up and started using the app.
Use clear, concise labels and placeholders for form fields.

Features:
Social login options (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple) for quick signup.
Autofill support for fields like email and password.
Switch between light and dark mode

Outcome
Successfully completed the mobile signup flow design with a focus on simplicity and usability.
